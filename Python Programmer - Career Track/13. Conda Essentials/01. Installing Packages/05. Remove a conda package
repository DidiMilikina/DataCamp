Remove a conda package
Finally, in direct package management, sometimes you want to remove a package. This is straightforward using the command conda remove PKGNAME. As with other commands, you may also optionally specify multiple packages separated by spaces.

Note that conda always tries to use the most recent versions of installed software that are compatible. Therefore, sometimes removing one package allows another package to be upgraded implicitly because only the removed package was requiring the older version of the dependency.
