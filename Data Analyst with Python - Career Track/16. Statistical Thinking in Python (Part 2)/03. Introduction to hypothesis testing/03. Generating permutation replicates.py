Generating permutation replicates
As discussed in the video, a permutation replicate is a single value of a statistic computed from a permutation sample. As the draw_bs_reps() function you wrote in chapter 2 is useful for you to generate bootstrap replicates, it is useful to have a similar function, draw_perm_reps(), to generate permutation replicates. You will write this useful function in this exercise.

The function has call signature draw_perm_reps(data_1, data_2, func, size=1). Importantly, func must be a function that takes two arrays as arguments. In most circumstances, func will be a function you write yourself.

Instructions
100 XP
Define a function with this signature: draw_perm_reps(data_1, data_2, func, size=1).
Initialize an array to hold the permutation replicates using np.empty().
Write a for loop to:
Compute a permutation sample using your permutation_sample() function
Pass the samples into func() to compute the replicate and store the result in your array of replicates.
Return the array of replicates.

SOLUTION
def draw_perm_reps(data_1, data_2, func, size=1):
    """Generate multiple permutation replicates."""

    # Initialize array of replicates: perm_replicates
    perm_replicates = np.empty(size)

    for i in range(size):
        # Generate permutation sample
        perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2 = permutation_sample(data_1, data_2)

        # Compute the test statistic
        perm_replicates[i] = func(perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2)

    return perm_replicates
