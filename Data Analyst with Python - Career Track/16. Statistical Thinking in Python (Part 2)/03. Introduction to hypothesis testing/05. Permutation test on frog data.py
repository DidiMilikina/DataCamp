Permutation test on frog data
The average strike force of Frog A was 0.71 Newtons (N), and that of Frog B was 0.42 N for a difference of 0.29 N. It is possible the frogs strike with the same force and this observed difference was by chance. You will compute the probability of getting at least a 0.29 N difference in mean strike force under the hypothesis that the distributions of strike forces for the two frogs are identical. We use a permutation test with a test statistic of the difference of means to test this hypothesis.

For your convenience, the data has been stored in the arrays force_a and force_b.

Instructions
100 XP
Define a function with call signature diff_of_means(data_1, data_2) that returns the differences in means between two data sets, mean of data_1 minus mean of data_2.
Use this function to compute the empirical difference of means that was observed in the frogs.
Draw 10,000 permutation replicates of the difference of means.
Compute the p-value.
Print the p-value.
