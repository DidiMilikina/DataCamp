Creating a float
Before we start looking for Bayes' kidnapper, we need to fill out a Missing Puppy Report with details of the case. Each piece of information will be stored as a variable.

We define a variable using an equals sign (=). For instance, we would define the variable height:

height = 24
In this exercise, we'll be defining bayes_age to be 4.0 months old. The data type for this variable will be float, meaning that it is a number.

Instructions
100 XP
Define a variable called bayes_age and set it equal to 4.0.
Display the variable bayes_age.
'''
SOLUTION
# Fill in Bayes' age (4.0)
bayes_age = 4.0

# Display the variable bayes_age
print(bayes_age)
